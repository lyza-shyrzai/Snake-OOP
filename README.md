My passage of course by GeekBrains [Object Oriented Programming](https://geekbrains.ru/courses/70).
In this repository was created the console version of the classic game "Snake", using C # and object-oriented programming (OOP). Each branch in the repository corresponds to a certain lesson of creation, game development stage.

The game consists of:

1. Snake (created with the help of asterisks)
2. Dollar sign (food for snake)
3. Borders of the screen (cons)
